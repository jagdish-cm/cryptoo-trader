# ADR-001: Component Architecture and Organization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The original trading dashboard had large, monolithic components (500+ lines) that were difficult to maintain, test, and reuse. Components mixed business logic, UI rendering, and data fetching, making them tightly coupled and hard to optimize.

## Decision

We decided to implement a modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### 1. Component Hierarchy

- **Pages**: Top-level route components that orchestrate data and layout
- **Domain Components**: Feature-specific components (trading, portfolio, analytics)
- **UI Components**: Reusable, generic components with consistent APIs
- **Layout Components**: Structural components for consistent layouts

### 2. Component Responsibilities

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex UIs by composing smaller components
- **Props Interface**: Well-defined TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at appropriate levels

### 3. Directory Structure

```
components/
├── analytics/       # AI analytics and performance components
├── config/          # Configuration and settings components
├── dashboard/       # Dashboard layout and navigation
├── portfolio/       # Portfolio management components
├── trading/         # Trading operations components
└── ui/              # Generic, reusable UI components
    ├── data-display/    # Tables, cards, metrics
    ├── feedback/        # Loading, error, empty states
    └── forms/           # Form inputs and validation
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
- **Reusability**: Generic UI components can be used across different features
- **Testability**: Isolated components are easier to unit test
- **Performance**: Smaller components enable better memoization and optimization
- **Developer Experience**: Clear structure makes it easier for new developers to contribute

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: More files and directories to manage
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the component hierarchy
- **Potential Over-abstraction**: Risk of creating too many small components

## Implementation Details

### Component Patterns

1. **Compound Components**: For complex UI patterns (e.g., Table with Table.Header, Table.Body)
2. **Render Props**: For sharing stateful logic between components
3. **Higher-Order Components**: For cross-cutting concerns (error handling, loading states)
4. **Custom Hooks**: For extracting and sharing component logic

### TypeScript Integration

- All components have strict TypeScript interfaces
- Props extend BaseComponentProps for consistency
- Generic components use TypeScript generics for type safety

### Performance Considerations

- React.memo for pure components
- useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- Lazy loading for heavy components

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Monolithic Components

- **Pros**: Simpler file structure, everything in one place
- **Cons**: Poor maintainability, difficult testing, performance issues
- **Rejected**: Doesn't scale with application complexity

### 2. Atomic Design Methodology

- **Pros**: Well-established pattern, clear component hierarchy
- **Cons**: Can be overly rigid, doesn't fit well with domain-driven design
- **Partially Adopted**: Used concepts but adapted to our domain needs

### 3. Feature-Based Organization

- **Pros**: Components grouped by business feature
- **Cons**: Harder to find reusable components, potential duplication
- **Rejected**: Conflicts with component reusability goals

## Review Date

This ADR should be reviewed in 6 months (July 2025) to assess the effectiveness of the chosen architecture.
