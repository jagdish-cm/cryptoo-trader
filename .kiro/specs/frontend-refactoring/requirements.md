# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the trading dashboard frontend application to improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience. The primary goal is to break down large files into smaller, more focused modules while maintaining all existing business logic and functionality. The refactoring will follow enterprise-level software engineering practices to create a more scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code files to be reasonably sized (around 500 lines maximum), so that I can easily understand, maintain, and modify individual components without cognitive overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the current codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all files exceeding 500 lines
2. WHEN refactoring large files THEN the system SHALL break them into logical, cohesive modules
3. WHEN splitting files THEN each resulting file SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN no file SHALL exceed 500 lines unless absolutely necessary for framework constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved code organization with clear separation of concerns, so that I can quickly locate and modify specific functionality without navigating through unrelated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL separate presentation logic from business logic
2. WHEN creating new modules THEN each module SHALL have a clear, single responsibility
3. WHEN structuring directories THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and logical grouping
4. WHEN extracting utilities THEN common functionality SHALL be moved to reusable utility modules
5. WHEN organizing hooks THEN custom React hooks SHALL be extracted to dedicated files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing business logic and functionality preserved exactly, so that the application continues to work identically after refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring components THEN all existing props interfaces SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN splitting files THEN all existing function signatures SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN reorganizing code THEN all existing state management logic SHALL function identically
4. WHEN extracting modules THEN all existing data flows SHALL remain intact
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the application SHALL pass all existing tests without modification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved TypeScript support and type safety, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new modules THEN each module SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces and types
2. WHEN extracting utilities THEN all functions SHALL have explicit return types
3. WHEN organizing components THEN all props SHALL have well-defined TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL report zero errors
5. WHEN splitting files THEN all imports and exports SHALL maintain proper type information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code patterns and architectural decisions, so that the codebase follows enterprise-level standards and is easy for team members to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent file naming conventions
2. WHEN organizing imports THEN the system SHALL use consistent import ordering and grouping
3. WHEN extracting components THEN the system SHALL follow consistent component structure patterns
4. WHEN creating utilities THEN the system SHALL follow consistent function organization patterns
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the codebase SHALL follow a documented architectural pattern

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved performance through better code splitting and lazy loading, so that the application loads faster and uses resources more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN large components SHALL be split to enable better tree-shaking
2. WHEN creating modules THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for lazy loading
3. WHEN extracting utilities THEN common utilities SHALL be organized to minimize bundle size
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the build output SHALL show improved bundle analysis metrics
5. WHEN implementing code splitting THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation updates, so that the refactored codebase is well-documented and easy for new team members to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new modules THEN each module SHALL have clear JSDoc comments explaining its purpose
2. WHEN extracting utilities THEN each utility function SHALL have comprehensive documentation
3. WHEN organizing components THEN each component SHALL have usage examples and prop documentation
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL update any relevant README files
5. WHEN documenting architecture THEN the system SHALL create or update architectural decision records
