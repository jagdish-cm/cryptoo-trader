# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an automated AI-based cryptocurrency trading system that operates continuously (24/7) using a multi-phase approach. The system combines technical analysis, sentiment analysis via Large Language Models (LLMs), and sophisticated risk management to execute trades across different market regimes. The algorithm follows a structured 7-phase process from background analysis to post-trade evaluation, with the ability to adapt its strategy based on overall market conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Continuous Data Ingestion and Processing

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want to continuously ingest and process market data from multiple sources, so that I can make informed trading decisions based on real-time information.

2. WHEN Bitcoin is in a sustained uptrend THEN the system SHALL set strategy mode to "Bull Mode (Long-Only)"
3. WHEN Bitcoin is in a sustained downtrend THEN the system SHALL set strategy mode to "Bear Mode (Short-Only)"
4. WHEN Bitcoin shows no clear long-term direction THEN the system SHALL set strategy mode to "Range Mode (Dual)"
5. WHEN strategy mode changes THEN the system SHALL immediately disable conflicting trade types and log the regime change
6. WHEN in Bull Mode THEN the system SHALL disable all short-selling functionality
7. WHEN in Bear Mode THEN the system SHALL disable all long-buying functionality

### Requirement 3: Technical Analysis and Setup Detection

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want to continuously scan price charts for predefined technical setups, so that I can identify potential trading opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning charts THEN the system SHALL analyze 4-hour timeframe data for all watchlist assets
2. WHEN detecting potential long setups THEN the system SHALL identify price nearing historical support, bullish MA crosses, and oversold RSI conditions
3. WHEN detecting potential short setups THEN the system SHALL identify price nearing historical resistance, bearish MA crosses, and overbought RSI conditions
4. WHEN a technical setup is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the asset for further analysis
5. WHEN multiple setups occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize them based on signal strength and asset liquidity

### Requirement 4: Multi-Faceted Signal Confirmation (Fusion Logic)

**User Story:** As a trading algorithm, I want to cross-examine technical signals with sentiment analysis and event detection, so that I can generate high-confidence trading signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a potential long setup is flagged THEN the system SHALL perform deeper TA confirmation including bullish candle patterns and MACD convergence
2. WHEN confirming a long setup THEN the system SHALL query the LLM module to analyze sentiment and check for negative events
3. WHEN a potential short setup is flagged THEN the system SHALL confirm bearish setup with rejection patterns and MACD divergence
4. WHEN confirming a short setup THEN the system SHALL query the LLM module to identify negative catalysts and FUD
5. WHEN generating a high-confidence LONG signal THEN the system SHALL require confirmed TA setup AND positive/neutral sentiment AND no critical negative events
6. WHEN generating a high-confidence SHORT signal THEN the system SHALL require confirmed TA setup AND negative sentiment AND presence of negative catalyst
7. IF any confirmation criteria fails THEN the system SHALL discard the signal and continue monitoring

### Requirement 5: Risk Management and Final Trade Validation

**User Story:** As a risk management system, I want to perform final checks before trade execution, so that I can ensure all trades comply with risk parameters and strategy constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a signal passes fusion logic THEN the system SHALL verify regime compliance with current strategy mode
2. IF strategy mode is Long-Only AND signal is SHORT THEN the system SHALL discard the signal immediately
3. IF strategy mode is Short-Only AND signal is LONG THEN the system SHALL discard the signal immediately
4. WHEN checking portfolio exposure THEN the system SHALL ensure no single asset or sector exceeds maximum concentration limits
5. WHEN checking volatility THEN the system SHALL postpone trades if asset volatility exceeds extreme thresholds
6. WHEN all risk checks pass THEN the system SHALL proceed to trade parameter calculation

### Requirement 6: Trade Parameter Calculation and Position Sizing

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want to calculate precise trade parameters including entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels, so that I can execute well-defined trades with appropriate risk management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating long trade parameters THEN the system SHALL set entry as limit buy price, stop-loss below key support, and multiple take-profit targets at resistance levels
2. WHEN calculating short trade parameters THEN the system SHALL set entry as limit sell price, stop-loss above key resistance, and multiple take-profit targets at support levels
3. WHEN determining position size THEN the system SHALL ensure maximum loss (entry to stop-loss) does not exceed 1% of total portfolio value
4. WHEN setting take-profit targets THEN the system SHALL identify multiple levels based on technical resistance/support zones
5. WHEN parameters are calculated THEN the system SHALL validate all prices are within reasonable market ranges

### Requirement 7: Trade Execution and Order Management

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want to execute trades through exchange APIs with proper order management, so that I can efficiently enter and manage positions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a trade THEN the system SHALL connect to the exchange via API and place the initial entry order
2. WHEN entry order is filled THEN the system SHALL immediately place OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other) orders with first take-profit and stop-loss
3. WHEN placing orders THEN the system SHALL handle API errors gracefully and retry failed requests up to 3 times
4. WHEN order execution fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and alert the monitoring system
5. WHEN orders are successfully placed THEN the system SHALL store all order details for tracking and management

### Requirement 8: Active Trade Management and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a trade management system, I want to actively monitor and manage open positions, so that I can optimize profits and respond to changing market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN price hits take-profit targets THEN the system SHALL sell portions of the position and move stop-loss to lock in gains
2. WHEN managing long positions THEN the system SHALL trail stop-loss upward as price advances
3. WHEN managing short positions THEN the system SHALL trail stop-loss downward as price declines
4. WHEN LLM detects critical negative events for long positions THEN the system SHALL trigger emergency exit regardless of profit/loss
5. WHEN LLM detects critical positive events for short positions THEN the system SHALL trigger emergency exit regardless of profit/loss
6. WHEN monitoring trades THEN the system SHALL continuously update position status and P&L calculations

### Requirement 9: Trade Logging and Performance Analysis

**User Story:** As a performance tracking system, I want to log all trade details and analyze performance metrics, so that I can continuously improve the algorithm's effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trade is closed THEN the system SHALL log entry signals, trade reasons, duration, profit/loss, and market conditions
2. WHEN logging trades THEN the system SHALL include all decision factors from each phase of the algorithm
